### Contact Tracing with Machine Learning

This project demonstrates the use of Machine Learning for digital contact tracing, focusing on stopping the spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19. By leveraging GPS data and the DBSCAN clustering algorithm, we can identify individuals who may have been infected by tracking the movements of diagnosed patients. DBSCAN effectively groups nearby data points and identifies outliers, making it suitable for this task. This repository contains code and documentation for implementing a digital contact tracing algorithm using these techniques.
